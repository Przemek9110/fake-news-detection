# Fake News Detection
## Project Description
This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
warnings
nltk
optuna
torch
sklearn
ydata_profiling
gensim
tqdm
Please ensure you have all these libraries installed before attempting to run the notebook.

## Running the Project
This project is presented as a Jupyter notebook which can be run using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Simply open the fake_news_detection.ipynb notebook and run the cells in order.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following stages:

Imports - Importing required libraries and setting necessary configurations.
Preprocessing - Preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Investigating the structure of the data, performing visualizations, etc.
Modeling - Training a model to predict whether a given news item is fake.
Evaluation - Assessing the performance of the model.
Each stage is presented in a separate section of the Jupyter notebook.
